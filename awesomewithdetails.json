This project aims to provide you with a list of some kata exercises that I've found in the Internet and the Github community. These exercises vary from general to more complex algorithms and real life situations for you to try using your preferred programming language. Remember that code katas are not quizzes or puzzles. You should not only try to 'solve' it, but find a very good solution, following best practices of the programming language you are using."}], "name": "Introduction"}, {"links": [{"url": "http://codekata.com/", "name": "CodeKata", "detail": "[CodeKata](http://codekata.com/)"}, {"url": "http://codekata.com/kata/kata01-supermarket-pricing/", "name": "Kata01: Supermarket Pricing", "detail": "  - [Kata01: Supermarket Pricing](http://codekata.com/kata/kata01-supermarket-pricing/)"}, {"url": "http://codekata.com/kata/kata02-karate-chop/", "name": "Kata02: Karate Chop", "detail": "  - [Kata02: Karate Chop](http://codekata.com/kata/kata02-karate-chop/)"}, {"url": "http://codekata.com/kata/kata03-how-big-how-fast/", "name": "Kata03: How Big?
